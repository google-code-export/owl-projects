# About #
OWL Project - is a small project consisting of several people. We are trying to keep an old device, which is no longer supported by its manufacturer, by making new Android versions for it as bugfree as it's possible.
For now we are developing only the new CyanogenMod version, which is CM 10.1. We plan to make 10.2 when it comes. We used to work on CM 10.0, but now it's history.

We are expanding our capabilities and the project ceases to something more ...
